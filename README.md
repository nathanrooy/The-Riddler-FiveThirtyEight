# The-Riddler-FiveThirtyEight

The Riddler is a math related weekly puzzle presented by FiveThirtyEight that I have become slightly addicted to. These are some of my Python scripts used to solve them...

- Orginal Question:
> There is a very long, straight highway with some number of cars (_N_) placed somewhere along it, randomly. The highway is only one lane, so the cars can’t pass each other. Each car is going in the same direction, and each driver has a distinct positive speed at which she prefers to travel. Each preferred speed is chosen at random. Each driver travels at her preferred speed unless she gets stuck behind a slower car, in which case she remains stuck behind the slower car. On average, _how many groups of cars_ will eventually form? (A group is one or more cars travelling at the same speed.)
> 
> For example, if the car in the very front happens to be slowest, there will be exactly one group — everybody will eventually pile up behind the slowpoke. If the cars happen to end up in order, fastest to slowest, there will be _N_ groups — no car ever gets stuck behind a slower car.

- Notes: I got the correct answer but through a brute force methodology...

- Original Question:
> The archvillain Laser Larry threatens to imminently zap Riddler Headquarters (which, seen from above, is shaped like a regular pentagon with no courtyard or other funny business). He plans to do it with a high-powered, vertical planar ray that will slice the building exactly in half by area, as seen from above. The building is quickly evacuated, but not before in-house mathematicians move the most sensitive riddling equipment out of the places in the building that have an extra high risk of getting zapped.
>
> _Where are those places_, and how much riskier are they than the safest spots? (It’s fine to describe those places qualitatively.)
> 
> _Extra credit_: Get quantitative! Seen from above, how many high-risk points are there? If there are infinitely many, what is their total area?
